Mainly focusing on opsec considerations and how to blend into normal traffic. Also going to modify an impacket script and write my own.

So you start to run psexec to login to boxes and grab stuff, secretsdump to dump hashes from the domain, creating a user account as a domain admin to flex in the report. What does impacket actually do when you do this?","Quick assumptions - You have the plain text pwd, ntlm hash and aes256 key (random but it’ll be used later)","Every time you run a script specifying kerberos and passing in a TGT impacket with use this TGT to request a TGS, for wmiexec it will request a CIFS ticket, then a HOST ticket four times. This is because impacket is not saving the ticket in memory and requesting a new one everytime.","This is strange in the context of a normal user doing normal user stuff, as in windows the tickets would be stored within the LUID. So the first time a TGT is requested it will be saved and used to request a TGS which will be also be saved in the LUID. When connecting to the service Windows will provide all the needed TGS tickets (or create new ones by providing the TGT). To mimic this on Linux we have to first request a TGT then request the TGS tickets and save them all to one file."]},{"i":"multiple-tickets-in-one-ccache-file","l":"Multiple Tickets In One Ccache File.","p":["You will soon come to realise that this is harder then it seems. If you request a CIFS ticket then pass that it makes it a bit better, but will instead change the SPN of the CIFS ticket to be a HOST ticket and use that in memory. (It will also request it multiple times). Requesting the CIFS ticket from the TGT, and validating it:","Then using this ticket for wmiexec.py:","This is a bit better, but still weird from the logs. As it would show that the user requested a TGT then a CIFS TGS then authenticated with a HOST ticket, that just appeared out of nowhere. Will a SOC be monitoring this? maybe idk I’m not a SOC Analyst, but if they are lets get rid of that and do it properly.","One possible way around this is to request the HOST ticket but not use it in the ccache. This will stop the “It appeared out of nowhere” detection chance, but I still don’t like it as the ticket generation time will be different. I want to give the SOC absolutely nothing to detect on. :D","Lets dive into the ccache structure and see if we can inject a second TGS.","https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/basic/ccache_def.html","credentials, plural meaning multiple.

So if we can extract out just the TGS and slap it onto the end of the ccache file it should be fine?","So how do we find the length of this header vaule?","I used impacket’s ccache.py file cause that seemed like a good place to start, and checked the length of the ticket before and after the header is passed out.
